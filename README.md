## 🎯 UX Research Objective

**How can we empower regional Nike teams to quickly identify key sales insights and user behavior patterns through visual tools?**

This project simulates how UX research can inform dashboard design and how insights derived from data can drive **user interface improvements** and **strategic decisions**.

---

## 👥 Target Users

- **Regional Marketing Teams**: Need insights into top-performing products and pricing patterns by region and time.
- **Product Designers**: Benefit from understanding category-specific interest across geographies.
- **Business Analysts**: Use filtering tools to explore shifts in revenue and category performance.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Used Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly) to extract patterns from structured sales data.
- **Dashboard Design**: Built interactive filters and visualizations using **Streamlit** to reflect user needs.
- **Usability Simulation**: Informally tested interface with peers, revised for clarity and interactivity.

---

## 🔍 Key UX Findings

- **Clear preference shifts** between price tiers across regions.
- **Time-sensitive category spikes** (e.g., Q1 vs. Q4 revenue patterns).
- Users preferred fewer, clearer filter options over dense visuals.
- Regional teams benefit from **month-by-month insights** to adjust campaign timing.

---

## 💡 Design Recommendations

- **Incorporate User Segments**: Allow filtering by user profiles or usage scenarios.
- **Narrative Visualization Layer**: Integrate short written insights above visuals.
- **Interactive Insights Tooltips**: Add hover text with user-impact explanations.

---

## 🖥️ Dashboard Features

- **Regional Filtering**: Select continent or country to see localized data trends.
- **Dynamic Visuals**: Line charts, bar plots, and treemaps updating in real time.
- **Category Breakdown**: Explore product performance by price tier and product line.
